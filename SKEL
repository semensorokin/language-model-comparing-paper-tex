Literature overview[b]

Previous research in the field [Laurinavichyute, A.K. et al., 2018] Anastasia

What hasn’t been researched/solved in previous research → gaps:

There are similar studies for other languages (German etc.), but none for Russian. Daria

The task of replacing the cloze task with a neural network (i.e. task of creating a cloze task model) is new. Daria

How the present study will cover the gap Anastasia

3.4. Overview of used metrics. Semen

        Mean accuracy

Absolute number of correct word predictions

        Context consistency

        Kolmagorov-Smirnov test

        Kullback–Leibler divergence Sergey

3.5. PoS tagging. Daria

3.6. Object - Modifier -  Verb - Functional tagging. Darya

3.7. Semantic comparison Darya
